  > A custom **64-bit Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)** was used as a keystream to XOR-encrypt two messages.
  > One of them is fully known in clear, the other hides the flag. The LCG parameters and seed were removed.
  > Recover the LCG and decrypt the flag. The flag format is `shellmates{...}`.
