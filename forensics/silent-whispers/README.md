# Silent Whispers

## 📡 Challenge Description

During a routine network inspection, a packet capture was flagged for unusual behavior.
At first glance, the traffic appears noisy and unremarkable: TCP, UDP, ICMP, even ARP.

Payload inspection reveals nothing useful.
No credentials.
No plaintext secrets.

Yet the investigator who captured this traffic insists that **something was transmitted**.

Your mission is to uncover what was *silently* sent.
